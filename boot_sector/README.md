# Bootsector Assembly

### What is boot sector ?
A boot sector is the sector of a persistent data storage device (e.g. hard disk, floppy disk, optical disc, etc.) which contains machine code to be loaded into random-access memory (RAM) and then executed by a computer system's built-in firmware (e.g., the BIOS, Das U-Boot, etc.).
```When the computer boots, the BIOS doesn't know how to load the OS, so it delegates that task to the boot sector. Thus, the boot sector must be placed in a known, standard location. That location is the first sector of the disk (cylinder 0, head 0, sector 0) and it takes 512 bytes.```

### The boot process
When the computer is powered on, it typically does not have an operating system or its loader in random-access memory (RAM). The computer first executes a relatively small program stored in read-only memory (ROM) along with a small amount of needed data, to access the nonvolatile device or devices from which the operating system programs and data can be loaded into RAM.

The small program that starts this sequence is known as a bootstrap loader, bootstrap or boot loader. This program's job is to load other data on RAM which are then executed.

Some computer systems, upon receiving a boot signal from a human operator or a peripheral device, may load a very small number of fixed instructions into memory at a specific location, initialize at least one CPU, and then point the CPU to the instructions and start their execution. These instructions typically start an input operation from some peripheral device (which may be switch-selectable by the operator). Other systems may send hardware commands directly to peripheral devices or I/O controllers that cause an extremely simple input operation (such as "read sector zero of the system device into memory starting at location 1000") to be carried out, effectively loading a small number of boot loader instructions into memory; a completion signal from the I/O device may then be used to start execution of the instructions by the CPU. ```_More on that later_```

### Boot sector program
#### Approach 1
##### You can either hard code all the _512_ bytes with a binary editor
It will look something like this:
```
e9 fd ff 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 55 aa
```

### Approach 2
##### Or else we can write a simple assembler code that does the above process for us
A very simple boot sector code in assembler (_Create a bootsector.asm file_)
In your _bootsector.asm_ write these lines of code
```
inf_loop:
    jmp inf_loop 

;Alternatively you can use __jmp $__ instruction instead of __inf_loop__
; We use _semicolons ;_ for comments in assembler 

times 510-($-$$) db 0

dw 0xaa55
```

__Compile this code using :__ nasm -f bin filename.asm -o filename.bin 

__Now what is happening here__
So basically filename.bin will do the same as defined in __Approach 1__

- The initial three bytes, in hexadecimal as 0xe9, 0xfd and 0xff, are actually machine code instructions, as defined by the CPU manufacturer, to perform an endless jump.
- The last two bytes, 0x55 and 0xaa, make up the magic number, which tells BIOS that this is indeed a boot block and not just data that happens to be on a driveâ€™s boot sector.
- The file is padded with zeros, basically to position the magic BIOS number at the end of the 512 byte disk sector.

### Booting from your bootsector
To boot from you binary file use the following command : _qemu-system-x86_64 filename.bin_
You will see the following screen in the qemu emulator:
